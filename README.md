# The Texts of Athena

## What is this?

This is a collection of resources, tricks, techniques or whatever you can think of which I learnt through my security journey

## Why did you made this when XYZ already exists?

I like to make things and break them, this is the part where I make something. I know and understand that something better than this exists but this was started with my mind being set on "You need a collection of  resources and tools". So this is the Avantika's version of this

## whoami?

This is Avantika([@iamavu](https://twitter.com/iamavu)), a curious girl who wants to learn everything that there exists, feel free to reach out to me if you have any queries or if you just want to have a chat ^^
