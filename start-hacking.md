## <mark style="color:red;">Linux</mark>

You need to know your way around Linux, while I highly suggest that you just install a Linux distribution on a VM and just play around with it, try to use it as your daily driver and that should equip you with knowledge needed as the best way to learn something is by actually doing it. But if you don't wanna do that, I suggest these following resources

## <mark style="color:red;">Programming</mark>

You will need a programming language, just the basics should be good, I'll recommend Python as it is widely popular and pretty much like English. I'll suggest approaching it in a way of making things, like for example, "I would like to make a port scanner", this helps a lot. See the video for reference
